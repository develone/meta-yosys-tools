The aarch64 image was created with poky yocto core-image-sato-raspberrypi4-64-20191220184100.rootfs.rpi-sdimg.  The image is 2.93Gb.  
This method of cross compiling provides several advantages over compiling on target.
1 The time to compile is greatly reduced over compiling on target.
2 The rpm or deb can be installed using the target package manager.
3 The binaries are only needed to be installed.
4 Provides a method for tracking license of the packages required to build the package.  
Just tested an icestorm rpm which was cross compiled & packaged on a Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 with poky yocto.  
The target raspberrypi4-64 was used to compile nextpnr.  Now nextpnr builds using icestorm install with 
rpm. The catzip.asc  created from nextpnr was use to create catzip.bin.  The catzip.bin loads and 
executes correctly on ice40 hx8k fpga with a rpi3B.  2 important steps were needed.  
rsync -avl bin share /usr/local/  
ln -sf /usr/local/bin/nextpnr-ice40 nextpnr-ice40
